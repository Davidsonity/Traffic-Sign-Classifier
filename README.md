### INTRODUCTION
#### Objectives
The objective of this project is to build powerful Deep Learning Neural network that can classify the German Traffic Signs with high accuracy.

In this project we made use of TensorFlow [![forthebadge made-with-python](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/tensorflow.png)](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

We would also be using transfer learning. The model used is the Xception model.
